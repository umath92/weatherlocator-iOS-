# weatherlocator-iOS-
The iOS app was developed in Microsoft's Hackathon 2015. Its main purpose is to serve customers who wish to travel for a couple of days and have no sense as to what to pack!
My foray into ObjectiveC and app designing began with the Microsoft Hackathon which was held about two weeks back. 
My team (me and another guy from USC) knew nothing about OjectiveC. We took this Hackathon as challenge to come up with something 'working' after 24hrs. 
We made a weather app which gives detailed information about the weather and the kind of clothes one needs to pack for a holiday or business trip. 
We plan on expanding the app by adding other features like available outdoor sports in the area, etc.
